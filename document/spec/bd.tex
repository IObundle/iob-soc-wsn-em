A high-level block diagram of Versat is presented in Figure
\ref{fig:versat_arch} and a brief explanation of each block is given
in Table~\ref{tab:blocks}.

     Controller & Main Versat controller. Reads instructions from the Instruction Bus and is the master of the Read/Write (RW) bus. Controls the Data Engine and the Configuration Module. \\
    \hline
     Program Memory & Stores the Versat Controller program. Program accessed via the Instruction Bus and loaded from the Data Interface or from the RW bus. \\
    \hline
     Control Register File & Used for communication between the host (Control Interface) and the Versat Controller (RW bus). \\
    \hline
     Data Engine & Performs computation on data vectors according to configuration supplied by Config Bus. Data loaded/unloaded by Data Interface.\\
    \hline
     Configuration Module & Holds current configuration of the Data Engine supplied via the Config Bus, and stores most used configurations. \\
